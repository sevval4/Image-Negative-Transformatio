Image Negative Transformation

This project demonstrates how to perform image negative transformation using OpenCV and NumPy in Python. The negative transformation involves inverting the pixel values of an image, which is useful in various image processing applications.

 
 Project Overview

In this project, we read a grayscale image and apply a transformation function to create its negative. The original image and its negative are then displayed side by side using Matplotlib for visual comparison.

 Features

- Reads an image from a specified path.
- Converts the image to a negative by inverting pixel values.
- Displays both the original and negative images using Matplotlib.

 Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
